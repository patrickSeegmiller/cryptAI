# cryptAI
 AI-assisted cryptanalysis of classical ciphers

cryptAI is an open-source library of Python tools for encryption, decryption, and cryptanalysis of classical ciphers.  using historical techniques for breaking ciphers in conjunction with modern cryptanalytic techniques augmented by natural language processing (NLP). 

Stay tuned for updates!

CAUTION: You should NOT use any tools in this library to secure actual sensitive information as the cipher implementations included in cryptAI are not cryptographically secure (this includes the RSA implementation). nor should you seek to access sensitive information for which you are not authorized. The ciphers included in cryptAI are NOT cryptographically secure. These tools are intended for entertainment purposes only!
