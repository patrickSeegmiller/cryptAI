# cryptML
 ML-assisted cryptanalysis of classical ciphers

cryptML is an open-source library of Python tools for encryption, decryption, and cryptanalysis of classical ciphers.  using historical techniques for breaking ciphers in conjunction with modern cryptanalytic techniques augmented by natural language processing (NLP). 

You will also find my own implementations of common functions for computations like the greatest common divisor of two whole numbers, the integer part of the square root of a whole number, and many others. These are solely for fun or for educational and you should probably just rely on the optimized versions available in standard libraries.

Stay tuned for updates!

CAUTION: You should NOT use any tools in this library to secure actual sensitive information as the cipher implementations included in cryptAI are not cryptographically secure (this includes the RSA implementation). nor should you seek to access sensitive information for which you are not authorized. The ciphers included in cryptAI are NOT cryptographically secure. These tools are intended for entertainment purposes only!
